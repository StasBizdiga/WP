The current laboratory work was of great help since I studied about animations - an interesting and captivating topic, me being an artist myself.
Starting with learning how to handle windows timer messages, I've grasped the way of working with animations within win32 API, since animations are simple frames put one after another at a certain rate. Thus I could perform it with the help of a timer and different adjustments to objects in the scene (device context). It was fun to complete therefore I'm excited to continue onward with the next laboratory work.
