\section*{Conclusions}
\phantomsection

The current laboratory work was of great use in terms of the fact that I learnt a whole lot: Starting from how to handle mouse messages, and their combinations and finishing with complex menu tools that aid in drawing, in any way we want on a surface - the so called "device context" (hdc). Also I've grasped the way of working with check-able system menus. It was challenging but fun to complete therefore I'm excited to continue unveiling the mysteries of Win32Api onward.
