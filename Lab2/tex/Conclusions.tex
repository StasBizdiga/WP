This was a very useful laboratory work due to the fact I learnt how to handle keyboard messages, and their combinations. Also I've understood the method of operating with system menus.
And also I've realized that scroll bars are not as basic and obvious. Turns out you can input any kind of code to be executed due dragging the scroll bars right or left, up or down, according to whatever you put in the HSCROLL and VSCROLL cases to be handled.
