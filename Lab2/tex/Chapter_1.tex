\section{Laboratory work implementation}

\subsection{Tasks and Points}
Basic Level:

    - Create a Windows application what will display a dialog box on some event (ex. on clicking some button)
    
    - Add a system menu to your application with at least 3 items (add actions to that items)
   
    - Hook keyboard input. Add 2 custom events for 2 different keyboard combinations


Normal Level:

    - Realize the tasks from Basic Level.

    - Add 2 scroll bars that will manage main window size or position

Features:

- On clicking the MICRO button, the window shrinks to its minimal size. It then displays a dialog box as required by the first task.
